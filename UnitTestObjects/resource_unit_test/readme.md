In order to include the unit tests for the ```ResourcePathValidator```, but not have unecessary *Resources* assets included with this project I have set this test to be ignored and renamed the *Resources* folder it was using for the unit test to *resource_unit_test*. In order to run this unit test, comment out the ```[Ignore]``` attribute in the unit test class ```ResourceContractProjectValidatorTests``` and rename this folder to *Resources*
